# Mods needed

* Currently we have Better questing and hardcore questing mods for 1.12, Better questing does not have a gate feature and HQM's gate doesnt work at all. Need a gate that works.
* Need Custom Achievements to port over to 1.12 to allow for advancements to be assigned pack wide and not be tied to a world save. I also need it for the custom click type trigger that dyonovan added. Else the spawn building / team portion wont work.
* Need the indestructible blocks ported to 1.12 from BR Core. To build the spawn structure with and to set the mods locks behind.\
* Need custom items from BR-Core 1.7 ported to 1.12 for the research items created in the runic alter and assembly table and consumed by a quest mod.
* Need GalactiCraft to port to 1.12, This can be changed but currently the idea behind the pack relies on this mod being included.
* Need a backup to buildcrafts assembly table that supports craft tweaker scripts. (thinking of https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/modular-machinery) would be a good replacement for the assembly table
* Would like for https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/vocation To be ported to 1.12, Planned on using it inside the spawn structure and in general in place of text descriptions. you can see a short demo of what its capable of here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBEE0I6BIsg would be using it with triggers in the spawn structure to guide players and act as a AI of sorts for the ship aka spawn structure.

#Stuff needed to be done

* Finalize mod selection
* OreGen depending on final mod selection
* Quest book and research recipes
* Building the spawn structure and scripting it.
* Finalize early game that does not depend on unlocking mods.

More later
